# Review Speed Analytics
This app extracts the review speed of journal articles which are then visualized in a simple [Dash app](https://review-speed.herokuapp.com/) and can also be [downloaded](https://github.com/amnsbr/review-speed-data). The review speed for each article is individually extracted from its web-page, using the received, accepted and published dates. Currently can extract the review speeds from only a few publishers including Elsevier, Springer-Nature, Karger, Hindawi and Taylor and Francis, but more publishers will be supported in the future, provided that the dates are reported in their web-pages. The app is not fully tested and actively maintained, so bugs may occur and I really appreciate contributions.
